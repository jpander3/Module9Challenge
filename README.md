#Project Title Module9Challenge - Employee SQL Analysis - SQL Challenge

#Project Description It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

#Getting Started 


GET RID OF: If a school system would like to use this code they would need to provide Student Data and School Data in csv files. Student Data should include Student ID, Student Name, Gender, Grade, School Name, Reading Score, and Math Score. School Data should include School ID, School Name, School Type, School Budget, School Size(number of students).
